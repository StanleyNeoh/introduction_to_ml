# PyTorch Training

This repository is a compilation of PyTorch training scripts for various tasks as I learn the basics of PyTorch.

I am referencing the following courses on Coursera:
* [Introduction to Machine Learning by Duke University](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-duke)

## Setup and Installation

To setup the workspace, you will need to setup a virtual environment and install the required packages.

This can be done by running the following commands:

```
python3 -m venv venv

// If you are on Windows

venv\Scripts\activate.bat

// If you are on Linux or Mac

source venv/bin/activate
```

Then, install the required packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Topics covered in this repository
